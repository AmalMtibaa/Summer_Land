# Summer_Land
SummerLand is a project that I worked on with two colleagues as an assignment for the software architecture course. Our project aims to facilitate holidays houses' rental in Tunisia by providing a friendly user interface that helps in one hand the seeker of a house/apartment/guest house to easily search and filter what he is looking for. In the other hand, it helps the landlord to advertise his services and facilitate the communication between them.
